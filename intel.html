<h2><b>ABOUT SENSORS</b></h2>
<P>Sensor/Detectors/Transducers are electrical, opto-electrical, or electronic devices composed of specialty electronics or otherwise sensitive materials, for determining if there is a presence of a particular entity or function. Many types of sensors, detectors, and transducers are available including those for detecting a physical presence such as flame, metals, leaks, levels, or gas and chemicals, among others. Some are designed to sense physical properties such as temperature, pressure, or radiation, while others can detect motion or proximity. They operate in a variety of manners depending on the application and may include electromagnetic fields, or optics, among others. Many applications over a wide range of industries use sensors, detectors, and transducers of many kinds to test, measure, and control various processes and machine functions. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for sensors as a primary tool to provide enhanced automation is increasing.</P>

<h3><strong>TYPES</strong></h3>
<body>
<p>There are,</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Temperature Sensor</b></li>
<p>One of the most common and most popular sensors is the Temperature Sensor. A Temperature Sensor, as the name suggests, senses the temperature i.e., it measures the changes in the temperature.There are different types of Temperature Sensors like Temperature Sensor ICs (like LM35, DS18B20), Thermistors, Thermocouples, RTD (Resistive Temperature Devices), etc. </p>

<li><b>Proximity Sensors</b></li>
<p>A Proximity Sensor is a non-contact type sensor that detects the presence of an object. Proximity Sensors can be implemented using different techniques like Optical (like Infrared or Laser), Sound (Ultrasonic), Magnetic (Hall Effect), Capacitive, etc.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\Types-of-Sensors-Image-4.jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Infrared Sensor (IR Sensor)</b></li>
<p>IR Sensors or Infrared Sensor are light based sensor that are used in various applications like Proximity and Object Detection. IR Sensors are used as proximity sensors in almost all mobile phones.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\Types-of-Sensors-Image-5.jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Ultrasonic Sensor</b></li>
<p>An Ultrasonic Sensor is a non-contact type device that can be used to measure distance as well as velocity of an object. An Ultrasonic Sensor works based on the properties of the sound waves with frequency greater than that of the human audible range.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\Types-of-Sensors-Image-6.jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Light Sensor</b></p>
<p>Sometimes also known as Photo Sensors, Light Sensors are one of the important sensors. A simple Light Sensor available today is the Light Dependent Resistor or LDR. The property of LDR is that its resistance is inversely proportional to the intensity of the ambient light i.e., when the intensity of light increases, its resistance decreases and vise-versa.By using LDR is a circuit, we can calibrate the changes in its resistance to measure the intensity of Light. There are two other Light Sensors (or Photo Sensors) which are often used in complex electronic system design. They are Photo Diode and Photo Transistor. All these are Analog Sensors.</p>

<li><b>Smoke and Gas Sensors</b></li>
<p>One of the very useful sensors in safety related applications are Smoke and Gas Sensors. Almost all offices and industries are equipped with several smoke detectors, which detect any smoke (due to fire) and sound an alarm.Gas Sensors are more common in laboratories, large scale kitchens and industries. They can detect different gases like LPG, Propane, Butane, Methane (CH4), etc.</p> 
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\Smoke-Sensor-MQ2.jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Alcohol Sensor</b></li>
<p>As the name suggests, an Alcohol Sensor detects alcohol. Usually, alcohol sensors are used in breathalyzer devices, which determine whether a person is drunk or not. Law enforcement personnel uses breathalyzers to catch drunk-and-drive culprits.</p>

<li><b>Touch Sensor</b></li>
<p>We do not give much importance to touch sensors but they became an integral part of our life. Whether you know or not, all touch screen devices (Mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops, etc.) have touch sensors in them. Another common application of touch sensor is trackpads in our laptops.Touch Sensors, as the name suggests, detect touch of a finger or a stylus. Often touch sensors are classified into Resistive and Capacitive type. Almost all modern touch sensors are of Capacitive Types as they are more accurate and have better signal to noise ratio.</p> 
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\Touch-Sensor-Module (2).jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Color Sensor</b></li>
<p>A Color Sensor is an useful device in building color sensing applications in the field of image processing, color identification, industrial object tracking etc. The TCS3200 is a simple Color Sensor, which can detect any color and output a square wave proportional to the wavelength of the detected color.</p> 
<img src="C:\Users\pnrra\Downloads\TCS3200-Color-Sensor.jpg"width="450"height="300">
<li><b>Humidity Sensor</b></li>
<p>If you see Weather Monitoring Systems, they often provide temperature as well as humidity data. So, measuring humidity is an important task in many applications and Humidity Sensors help us in achieving this.Often all humidity sensors measure relative humidity (a ratio of water content in air to maximum potential of air to hold water). Since relative humidity is dependent on temperature of air, almost all Humidity Sensors can also measure Temperature.</p>
